`initModule()`                        | Initializes internal data structures and prepares environment for execution.  
`processData(input)`                   | Accepts raw input, applies validation, and transforms it into structured output.  
`calculateError(values)`               | Computes numerical error bounds using central difference scheme.  
`syncThreads()`                        | Demonstrates use of mutexes and semaphores for safe parallel execution.  
`exportReport(path)`                   | Saves results into HTML/Markdown format for reproducibility and later review.

### Notes
- Functions are designed with **explicit synchronization** to avoid race conditions.  
- Error analysis follows **numerical methods** principles (integration/differentiation).  
- Documentation enriched with **examples** and **rationale** for maintainability.
